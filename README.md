# Talent Registry System

The **Talent Registry System** is a blockchain-based solution for managing skilled individuals available to contribute to community projects and initiatives. The system facilitates the creation, modification, and querying of talent records, ensuring data integrity through validation mechanisms for expertise, availability, and personal identifiers.

## Features
- **Create Talent Entry**: Register new talent with expertise, region, and weekly capacity.
- **Modify Talent Record**: Update talent details such as expertise, availability, and region.
- **Query Talent Information**: Retrieve talent details, including expertise, location, availability, and more.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures only valid entries are registered with proper error handling for duplicate entries, invalid expertise, and capacity issues.
- **Verify Talent Registration**: Check the registration status of talent.
